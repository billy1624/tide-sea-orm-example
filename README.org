* tide-sea-orm-example
This is an example to showcase how Tide + Sea-ORM work together and
the issue with tests.

** Setup
To have the application working you have setup the database locally with
- username = tide
- password = tide_pass
- host = localhost
- port = 5432
- database = tide_db

which is formatted into database_string "postgres:/tide:tide_pass@localhost:5432/tide_db"

For simplicity sake I have added `docker-compose.yaml` which will do that for
you if you have docker installed. All you need to do is to run with
`docker-compose up -d`

** Running tide server
Once the database is running all you need is to run `cargo run`

** Running tests
This is the part I want to highlight which is failing because of `Clone` in
relation to `sea-orm` feature called `mock`.

`cargo test` will fail with error.
